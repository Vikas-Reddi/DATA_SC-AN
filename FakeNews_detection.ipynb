        "Standing up for Indians across the world, PM Modi's strong statement comes as India-Canada relations have hit a low point since the former withdrew its diplomats following allegations of violence against Sikh separatist Khalistani leaders on Canadian soil.\n",
        "\"I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada. Equally appalling are the cowardly attempts to intimidate our diplomats. Such acts of violence will never weaken India’s resolve. We expect the Canadian government to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law,\" PM Modi posted on X.” Earlier, the MEA also condemned the attack on the Hindu Sabha Temple in Brampton, Ontario, reportedly carried out by alleged Sikh extremists, calling the incident \"deeply disturbing.\"\n",
        "\"We condemn the acts of violence perpetrated by extremists and separatists at the Hindu Sabha Temple in Brampton, Ontario yesterday. We call on the Government of Canada to ensure that all places of worship are protected from such attacks. We also expect that those indulging in violence will be prosecuted. We remain deeply concerned about the safety and security of Indian nationals in Canada. The outreach of our Consular officers to provide services to Indians and Canadian citizens alike will not be deterred by intimidation, harassment and violence,\" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.\n",
        "According to the community organisation Hindu Canadian Foundation, women and children were also attacked in the violent mob.\n",

        "It had firmly rejected Trudeau's allegations against its diplomats, labeling them as \"baseless\" and politically motivated. The MEA had accused Trudeau of exploiting anti-India rhetoric for domestic political gain, highlighting his previous associations with separatist elements.\"\"\"\n",
